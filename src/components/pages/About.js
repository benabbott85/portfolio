      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="aboutme">
      <p> I was born in New York City on May 13, 1988, and yes that was Friday the 13th. I am the second of two boys,
              my
              older brother is Zach.
              My father has been a practicing labor lawyer for over 40 years working mostly with unions. My mom was a stay
              at home mom and also
              a choreographer on the side.
              I grew up in a small town, Point Lookout, on the south shore of Long Island about an hour east of the city.
          </p>
  
          <p> After high school, I left New York to attend the University of Colorado at Boulder. I studied communication
              and
              graduated in 2010 with a
              Bachelor of Arts. Following college, I moved to Park City, Utah to enjoy a year as a ski bum. It was
              probably
              the best year of my life.
              I worked in a restaurant and skiied over 100 days.
          </p>
  
          <p> After my ski bum year ended, I moved back to New York and settled in Williamsburg, a section of Brooklyn. I
              worked in the city doing benefits
              administration for collectively bargained union health and pension funds. After about 2.5 years of that, I
              moved
              back to Denver because it seemed
              as if something was missing. I moved back almost six years ago now and have found a truly enjoyable life
              here in
              Colorado.
          </p>
  
          <p> I decided to get into coding while at my last job. The company ran their own coding boot camp and that is
              what
              first truly made me think about it.
              After leaving that company I came to the decision that this was the best decision for me and for my future.
